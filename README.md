Enterprise Services for jBPM 5

Note too that you need to update the arquillian.xml to point to a JBoss EAP 6.1 server, and need to setup the server to include a MySQL driver.  You also need MySQL installed in order to run the tests.  I created two schemas, jbpm-main and jbpm-task.  Also, a user: jbpm with password: jbpm.
